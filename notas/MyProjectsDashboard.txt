Okay, so for now the preliminary design of the FIND CREATORS Landing page is fine. We'll tweak it, but not for now.

Now I want you to generate the MY PROJECTS DASHBOARD page. It will be a panel for let the Users of Feedback.com that have projects and are Creators see all posts of all your products. Filtering by project and Type of Post and Status of the Post. 

The inspiration is this link:
https://www.featurebase.app/features/feedback-collection

And the first screenshot that I will provide you.

I want also that you follow my Feedback.com Styling Guidelines that you have been following with me and you can see in the second and rest screenshots




Explanation of the Design
Header:

Consistent with Feedback.com's styling, it has the title on the left and "Login" and "Register" buttons on the right. Styled for a dark theme with colors that provide good contrast.
Filters Section:

Includes dropdown menus to filter by Project, Post Type, and Post Status, with a prominent "Apply Filters" button.
Backgrounds and colors align with the dark theme, providing a cohesive look with the rest of the dashboard.
Projects Table:

Displays posts in a table format with columns for upvotes, title, type, status, comments, and date.
Uses distinct colors for each status (e.g., "In Review," "Planned") with badge-style elements, enhancing readability and scannability.
Styled to fit the dark theme, with light text and background contrasts.
Interactivity:

Rows and filters respond with hover effects for a more interactive experience.
Each row in the table has a hover effect, enhancing usability and making it easier for users to identify specific posts.
This dashboard page provides a clear, organized view of posts, filtered by project, type, and status, with a modern dark theme that enhances readability and focus on content. Let me know if there are any specific adjustments you’d like!



Please, not dark theme for now. It will be implemented later. Follow strictly the Feedback.com Styling Guidelines, please.


Explanation of the Design
Header:

Matches Feedback.com’s branding with a white background and #2CD8D5 buttons for consistency.
Filters Section:

Positioned above the table, with filters for Project, Post Type, and Status.
Apply Filters button follows the primary color scheme for a cohesive look.
Projects Table:

Organized layout displaying posts with columns for upvotes, title, type, status, comments, and date.
Light theme with subtle dividers for readability.
Status badges (Planned, In Review, Active, Done) in brand colors to make each status distinct and easy to scan.
This design ensures clarity, consistency with Feedback.com’s styling guidelines, and a user-friendly layout for browsing project feedback and post status. Let me know if there are any additional tweaks you'd like!


Ok, el primer diseño preliminar esta bien. Ahora vamos a retocar el tema de la tabla.

Por ahora hemos construido esta dashboard mediante una tabla para un archivo HTML pensado en solitario.

Pero realmente esta pagina va a formar parte de un proyecto en Symfony PHP y será una template de Twig renderizada a partir de un Controller y una Entidad.

La entidad POST es esta:

¿Realmente lo dejaremos construido como una tabla de HTML e iremos incrustando los valores de cada atributo de cada instancia de POST en cada celda? ¿Habra que usar un bucle? Piensa en como implementar el diseño anterior de MY PROJECTS DASHBOARD que creaste en HTML para implementarlo en el proyecto de PHP Symfony y TWIG de Feedback.com


Ok, the first preliminary design is fine. Now we are going to tweak the table issue.

For now we have built this dashboard using a table for an HTML file thought up alone.

But really this page is going to be part of a Symfony PHP project and it will be a Twig template rendered from a Controller and an Entity.

The POST entity is this:

Are we really going to leave it built as a table?
