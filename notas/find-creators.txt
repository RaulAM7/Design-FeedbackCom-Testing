Okay, so for now the preliminary design of the UPDATE USER DATA Landing page is fine. We'll tweak it, but not for now.

Now I want you to generate the FIND CREATORS page. It will be a panel for let the users of Feedback.com see all the Creators Cards.

The inspiration is this link:

And the first screenshot that I will provide you.

I want also that you follow my Feedback.com Styling Guidelines that you have been following with me and you can see in the second and rest screenshots





Explanation of the Design
Header:

Consistent with Feedback.com styling, the header has the logo/title on the left and buttons for "Login" and "Register" on the right, styled to match previous pages.
Page Title:

A prominent title, "Find Creators," centered and styled for visual impact.
Creator Grid:

The creator cards are displayed in a responsive grid layout, adapting to screen width with a minimum card width of 250px.
The grid provides a clean, organized way to browse through different creators.
Creator Card Design:

Card Layout: Each card has a centered layout with padding, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow. It uses a hover effect to slightly elevate the card for interactivity.
Image: Circular profile image at the top, creating a personal feel.
Category Label: Positioned at the top of each card in bold and a distinctive color (#FF3860) for easy scanning.
Creator Details: Name and title are styled with bold and regular text, respectively, to differentiate the hierarchy.
Description: Brief description to give users an idea of each creator's work.
Read More Link: A link that encourages users to learn more, styled with the brand color for consistency.
This layout combines a modern, clean aesthetic with a structured approach, making it easy for users to explore and find creators on Feedback.com. Let me know if youâ€™d like any adjustments or additions to the design!
